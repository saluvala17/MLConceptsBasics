1)Regression
2)Classification 
3)Cluster analysis


1) Regression: 

1.1 Linear Regression: in this, dependent variable is continuous and independent variable can be continuous or discrete and 
nature of line is linear. 
1.2 Logistic regression : it is used to find the probability of the event success and event failure.
We use this when the dependent variable is binary(0 or 1 / yes or No)
1.3 Polynomial Regression
1.4 stepwise regression
1.5cRidge regression 
1.6 Lasso Regression 
1.7 Elasticnet regression
1.8 Gradient Boosting

3) Cluster Analysis: in this we have following algorithms. 

3.1 Distribution based methods
3.2 Centroid based methods
3.3 Connectivity based methods
3.4 Density models
3.5 Subspace clustering
