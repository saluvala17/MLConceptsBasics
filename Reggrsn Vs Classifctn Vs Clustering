1) Regression: 
1)Linear Regression: in this, dependent variable is continuous and independent variable can be continuous or discrete and nature of line is linear. 2) Logistic regression : it is used to find the probability of the event success and event failure.We use this when the dependent variable is binary(0 or 1 / yes or No)
3) Polynomial Regression4) stepwise regression5)Ridge regression 6)Lasso Regression 7) Elasticnet regression8) Gradient Boosting
